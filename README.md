# Real-time-Streaming-Data-Pipeline-using-Flink-and-Kinesis
Data quickly loses value as conditions change, making it less useful over time. Common in IoT systems, it enables real-time insights and faster decisions through edge computing. This project simulates real-time accident data and builds a pipeline for quick analysis using AWS Kinesis, Apache Flink, Grafana, and Amazon SNS.

Architecture Overview

The pipeline follows a modern event-driven streaming architecture built entirely on AWS:

Data Source
	•	A CSV file containing U.S. accident data is stored in Amazon S3.
	•	A Python application reads the CSV and continuously streams records to Amazon Kinesis, simulating real-time events.

Data Ingestion
	•	Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (Stream 1) receives raw streaming accident data.
	•	This stream acts as the primary ingestion layer for all downstream consumers.

Stream Processing (Apache Flink)
	•	Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics (Apache Flink) processes incoming records in real time.
	•	Performs transformations, filtering, aggregations, and enrichment on the streaming data.
	•	Outputs processed data into Kinesis Data Streams (Stream 2) for further consumption.

Data Storage (Data Lake)
	•	Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
	•	Delivers raw streaming data into an Amazon S3 Raw Layer bucket.
	•	AWS Glue
	•	Writes transformed and curated data into an Amazon S3 Analytics Layer bucket.
	•	This setup follows a multi-layer data lake architecture (Raw & Analytics layers).

Monitoring & Visualization
	•	AWS Lambda
	•	Consumes processed events from Stream 2.
	•	Amazon CloudWatch
	•	Collects metrics and logs generated by Lambda.
	•	Amazon Managed Grafana
	•	Visualizes real-time metrics and trends for monitoring and observability.

Notifications & Alerts
	•	Amazon SNS
	•	Triggered when AWS Lambda is down, fails, or becomes unresponsive.
	•	Sends alerts or notifications to subscribed endpoints (email, SMS, etc.).
Data Flow Summary
	1.	Accident CSV stored in S3
	2.	Python app streams records to Kinesis Data Streams (Stream 1)
	3.	Apache Flink processes data in real time
	4.	Processed data sent to Kinesis Data Streams (Stream 2)
	5.	Raw data stored in S3 via Firehose
	6.	Analytics-ready data stored in S3 via AWS Glue
	7.	Lambda processes events and publishes metrics
	8.	Grafana visualizes metrics from CloudWatch
	9.	SNS sends alerts based on defined conditions
